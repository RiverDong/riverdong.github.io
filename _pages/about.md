Hi! I am a senior at University of Pennsylvania. 
My primary research interest is incorporating knowledge and reasoning into natural language generation(NLG). 
I am excited about enhaning NLG's factuality, logical coherence and explainability by adding in knowledge graph and world model.

\\
I worked on creating new evaluation framework for NLG with Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ungar/)  
and [Joao Sedoc](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/joao-sedoc).
I am working on incorporating world model into story generation with Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/).
\\
I also worked on multi-lingual information retrieval as an applied scientist intern at Amazon.
I worked on bot detection via text mining as a machine learning engineer intern at Roblox.
